compilation : human understanding
assembler : cpu specific with os specific switch.
            - exm. mov/sub instructions operating on general purpose registers(variable holders) to binary, jmp flow control statements
            // check https://www.massey.ac.nz/~mjjohnso/notes/59102/notes/l9.html for reference
            - bootcode, os dev, drivers. c otherwise.
machine code : cpu : hardware : follows instructions // aka opcode

# Implementation of single source shortest path algorithm using Dijkstra's algo.(Not sure if spelled right.)
 - Sample graph instance from wikipedia.
 - Unlike in wiki, my implementation uses map (instead of arrays) 
for things like previous node, current shortest path because that's why maps are for(mapping + readability).
 - I also do away with positive infinity distance for unvisited nodes because that's just silly.
